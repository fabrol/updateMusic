updateMusic
===========

sudo-apt get for music

We all have artists we want to keep track of, but I couldnt find an easy way to do this - in comes updateMusic(tentative name).
Specify a list of bands that you want to keep up with. The app checks for any new releases that you don't already own by the bands. It then lets you see all these new albums and links to the Itunes page for them.

The interface is meant for people comfortable with opening up a command line. :)
